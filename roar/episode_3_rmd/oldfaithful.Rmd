## Introduction

The Old Faithful data set contains the waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.

First load the data:

```{r}
df <- faithful
```

The data description is given in the table below.

A summary of the distributions of each variable are as follow:

```{r}
summary(df)
```

The marginal distributions of the variables shown below:

```{r}
hist(df$eruptions)
```

```{r}
hist(df$waiting)
```

## Conclusions

Both the duration of eruptions and waiting time show a bimodal distribution. 

## Updated analysis

The scatter of the data (‘eruptions duration’ vs ‘waiting time’ ) is plotted below.

```{r}
plot(df$eruptions, df$waiting)
```
